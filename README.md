# Turism-prototype
The sixth group project with educational purposes involving virtual reality, in collaboration between my highschool and I (Brian García Gómez, from IES El Rincón) and few Marketting students from CIFP San Cristoval

Basically a combination of few pages related to each other like an oficial website, one of it's pages being an VR webpage,
allowing the user to use VR equipment and feel like they're somewhere else (In San Cristobal, Las Palmas of Gran Canaria).
